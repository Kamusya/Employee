# Employee
My OOP assignment 4 - company
Our Airline Reservation System consists of 3 classes: Employee, Passenger and Plane.
Employee consists of id, name, surname, gender, salary and position.
Passenger consists of id, name, surname, gender, ticket_price and flight_num.
Plane consists of id, name, flight_num and plane_company.
Project has the several methods such as getPassengerByIdMenu(), getAllPassengersMenu(), getPlaneNameByIdMenu() and others. 
Also, project has lots of options like Going Back to the main menu.

With the help of this project we can insert and get the data about numbers of plane flights and which flight is flied by which passenger.
In the future it can be developed by adding timetable of airline, date, graphics and other classes.
